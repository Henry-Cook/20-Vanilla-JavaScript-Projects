# 20-Vanilla-JavaScript-Projects
These are small basic projects I made following Brad Travery's Course on Udemy Called 20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript. It's a little simple compared to some of the things I am doing now, but it was alot of fun to get back in touch with the basics.

#1: Form Validator - Simple registration form validation, checks username and password for length, chekcs email for proper format, and then checks to make sure the confirmation password matches the first one. 

#2: Movie Seat Booking - You can  pick a movie and pick seats. Can't pick seats that are already taken. Each movie has a different price, which is updated accordingly. Everything is saved in local storage.
